      <p>Welcome to TellUsWho! This is a social networking survey tool that is looking to bridge the gap between studentâ€™s campus life and their social networks. This is currently a pilot study which means that not all features will be available for use. The goal of this pilot study is for you to create a profile, download a mobile app to collect your phone contacts, and answer questions about your social network on campus. If you would like to participate in the next iteration of this study which includes using our mobile app to find people on campus and coordinate activities with friends, please let the researcher know at the end of this study.
